      <h2> How to exercise your data protection rights</h2>
      <p>
        You have certain choices available to you when it comes to your personal information. Below is a summary of
        those choices, how to exercise them and any limitations. Under certain circumstances, you have the right to: •
        Request access to your personal information. This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we
        hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it. • Request correction of the personal information
        that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you
        corrected. • Request erasure of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove
        personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. • Object to processing of
        your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is
        something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground. You also
        have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes. •
        Request the restriction of processing of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the
        processing of personal information about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason
        for processing it. • Request the transfer of your personal information to another party (also known as data
        portability). • Where our processing is solely based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw your
        consent at any time. Such withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its
        withdrawal. If you wish to exercise any of the data protection rights that are available to you then please send
        your request to our Data Protection Officer by email at dpo@getbybus.com and we will action your request in
        accordance with applicable data protection laws. You have the right to complain to your local data protection
        authority if you are unhappy with our data protection practices. In Denmark, complaints can be lodged with
        Datatilsynet. You can read more about how to lodge a complaint on Datatilsynet’s website here.
